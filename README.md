# Sharpening Filter Image Processing
 The sharpening filter used in image processing is applied to a randomly generated matrix with for loops.
 
 ## Sharpening Filter
 - Sharpening as name suggests is used to sharpen and highlight the edges and make the transitioning of features and details more significant. However  sharpening doesn't take into account whether it is highlighting the original features of the image or the noise associated with it. It enhances both.
- This project was implemented using the sharpening filter matrix of [[0,-1,0],[-1,5,-1],[0,-1,0]].
